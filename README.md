# Ada-lab
The lab exercises typically involve implementing classic algorithms like sorting, searching, graph traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), divide-and-conquer techniques, dynamic programming (Floyd-Warshall, Knapsack problem), greedy algorithms, and more.
These programs serve as the foundation for tackling more complex computational problems in future studies or projects.
